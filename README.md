# PasswordGeneratorWk03

## Description

In this lesson we were to use what we learned with JavaScript and create a passwword generator. Within the password generator we were to give the user some interactive options between how many characters they wanted, if they wanted speacial characters and if the user wanted upper and lowercase letters within their password.
